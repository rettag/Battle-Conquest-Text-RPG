# battle-conquest-text-rpg
A text role play game made I made during the Shammy Game Jam at the Univerity of Michigan! We had 48 hours to create a game. Sadly, I joined late and only had about 12 hours. For my first game I thought it turned out awesome! I appreciate the simplistic vibe from text rpgs.

Download all the .cpp and .h files and fun main.cpp to play the game.
